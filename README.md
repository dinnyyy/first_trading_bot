- This is my first attempt at creating and deploying a live trading bot
- It uses SP500 daily data
- Incorporates a HMM model with other technical indicators to make decisions
- Not too extreme, basic, just to get the feel of the process and how to accomplish each step
    - Formulating a solid ML model
    - Analysisng states
    - Backtesting the model with trading rules
    - Deploying the bot onto a Linux VPS
