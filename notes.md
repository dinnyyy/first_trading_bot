# Brief points
- stocks vs crypto? Would using sp500 be better or bitcoin. What is more common for bots.
- Bybit or binance for crypto
- Alpaca for stocks
- is hmm good for a trading bot? if not what alternatives. How can i expand on this model
- How to deploy bot, what do you need

Basic Model to begin with:
1. Data Source
- Daily or hourly S&P 500 data (e.g., SPY ETF).
- Indicators: RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, ATR, etc.

2. Indicators as Features
- Lagged returns: r_t, r_{t-1}, r_{t-2}
- RSI
- MACD signal
- Volatility (rolling std or GARCH estimate)
- Volume (optional)

3. Hidden Markov Model
- Use a GaussianHMM (e.g., 2 or 3 hidden states).
- Fit to returns and/or indicators.
- Use the inferred state as a regime label.

4. Trading Rule
- For example:
    State 0 (calm): Go long if RSI < 30 and MACD is positive
    State 1 (high vol): Avoid trading or tighten stops
    State 2 (trend): Ride trend if MA(5) > MA(20)

More advanced model:

1. Use GARCH for volatility prediction (forecast risk).
2. Use HMM to classify market regimes (e.g., quiet/trending/explosive).
3. Combine these as features in a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression or XGBoost) that:
    - Takes in lagged returns, volatility, indicators, regime labels, etc.
    - Outputs: Probability of price going up, or a trading signal.
4. Build a simple rule-based bot from that:
    - Long if prob > 0.55 and vol is low
    - Short if prob < 0.45 and trend is weakening
    - No trade otherwise
5. Implement strong risk management
